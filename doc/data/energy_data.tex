Estimated demand shortages

For the years 1995 to 2010 I use the data constructed by Alcott et al (2016). For the years 2011-2019 (TODO), I manually extend the series by using the reports available on the CEA website. The full reports, with the relevant tables separated out, are available in the online appendix. 

During the span of the sample, a few Indian states change their name. For these, I use the current name. This means that Orissa becomes Odisha, Pondicherry becomes Puducherry, and Uttaranchal becomes Uttarakhand.

Until 2005, Sikkim is not reported as a separate state, but under the West Bengal list
Telangana does not become a state until 2014 is therefor not included until then.
